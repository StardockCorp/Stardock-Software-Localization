## File Format
For details on how the files are formatted, please see:

As noted there, the en.lng file is the root of all others.  

Comments are started with a semi-colon, for example:

;Multiplicity 4

All other languages provided have been organized in the same fashion. 

**Note:** When testing locally, the lang file encoding needs to be UTF-16 LE.
