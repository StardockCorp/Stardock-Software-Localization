# Start11 v2 Language Localizations
## File Format
For details on how the files are formatted, please see:
https://github.com/StardockCorp/Stardock-Software-Localization#language-file-format-and-testing

As noted there, the en.lng file is the root of all others.  It is currently formatted where all Start11 v1 strings are at the top half of the file and the version 2 strings below the

> ;Start11v2

Separator (line 477).

All other languages provided have been organized in the same fashion. 

Start11 v1 translations are considered final as they have already been reviewed many times; focus should be placed on the v2 strings. However, the fit in the UI will still have to be ensured for all strings.

**Note:** When testing locally, the lang file encoding needs to be UTF-16 LE.  Github will not seem to accept that encoding so you will likely have to [resave it accordingly](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/notepad_2023-11-20_13-30-14sdrohan.png) after downloading
